                <h3>CHAPTER 1.3 Consonants</h3>

There are few problems lurking here for English speakers.

At the end of a word  b is always devoiced meaning it is pronounced as a ‘p’.
 [ab, Lob  ob]

Problem c
c in some words  (usually foreign words) is pronounced like a German z, => ‘ts’.
[Cicero  Mercedes]

Problem ch 
ch after a, o, u and au is pronounced as in Scottish ‘loch’. 
The Germans call this the ach-Laut, a hard sound.
[Bach, Loch, Buch  rauchen]

ch after e, i, ä, äu, ö, ü as well as the consonants l, n and r)
 is a softer sound than when it follows a, o, u and au.
It is pronounced with the tongue curved, hugging both the soft and hard palates. 
The Germans call this the ich-Laut, a soft sound. 
It must be clearly distinguished from the more guttural ach-Laut. 
[Blech, ich, lächeln, Schläuche, Löcher, Bücher, welche, manche  durch]

The two ch sounds can alternate within variations of the same
word when it is inflected. (with the ach sound or ich sound)
[Buch Bücher]

The combination chs is pronounced like English ‘x’.
[sechs, Dachs, Fuchs]. 

Compare sechs (6) with sechzehn (16) and
sechzig (60) where ch is pronunced as in Blech above.
The diminutive ending -chen is also pronounced with this soft
variant of ch.
[sechs sechzehn sechzig]

ch at the beginning of loanwords is pronounced like 1) English
‘k’, 2) English ‘sh’ or 3) soft German ch, depending on the
source language, e.g. 
1) [Chaos, Chlor, Charakter]; 
2) [Chance,chauvinistisch, Chef] 
3) [Chemie, China].

ck ck, found in the middle and at the end of words, is pronounced ‘k’
[lecker, Fleck].

d is pronounced as in English.
[denken Feder] 
At the end of a d is always devoiced, => it is pronounced as a ‘t’.
[Glied, Gold  Hand]


At the end of a g is always devoiced, => it is pronounced as a ‘k’. 
 [Tag, Teig and Zug] 

However, the ending -ig is pronounced like German ich
 [König and lustig] 

h at the beginning of a words is pronounced as in English.
[Haus, Horn  Hut]

After a vowel H is not pronounced but simply serves to show that the vowel is long.
[Floh, sehen, Schuhe]  
Sometimes this h is superfluous  but spelling requires it. 
[sieh sie liehst leihen liest lesen]

j  is pronounced ‘y’
[Jahr, jeder, Joch].
j in French loanwords is pronounced like the ‘s’ in ‘leisure’
[Journalist].



pf is pronounced as the spelling suggests. both the p and the f
are articulated, but this can be hard for English speakers at
the beginning of a word. 
And In some german regions it is just pronouced as an f.
[Pfeffer, Tropfen, Kopf]


q always occurs in combination with u, as in English, and
together they are pronounced ‘kv’.
 [Qualität, Quelle,Quadratmeter].

r In most of the German-speaking region r before a vowel is
pronounced by slightly trilling the uvula in the back of your
throat, but there are areas where, and individuals who, pronounce
it by trilling their tongue against their alveolar ridge, i.e. the ridge
of gum behind the top teeth, as in Italian

Either way r must be trilled, which usually means most English speakers have trouble
with this sound.
[Reh, reißen, Brot, schreiben].

After a vowel an r is vocalized, => it is pronounced as a vowel.
[in er, mir Uhr] 
you pronounce the vowel as you would expect it to be pronounced 
and follow it by ‘uh’, as in the colloquial question form ‘huh?,’
 => air-uh, mee-uh, oo-uh.

The common ending -er is simply pronounced ‘uh’; alternatively
you could say it resembles the second syllable in ‘teacher’, but
imagine this being spelt ‘teacha’, e.g. [Schuster] (shoos-tuh). 
The ending -ern is pronounced ‘airn’, not trilling the r
[wandern]

Note how -er and -e differ in pronunciation at the end of words:
[Mütter/Feuer]  [Hütte/Treue] 

s at the beginning and in the middle of a word is pronounced ‘z’,
[sollen, lesen, Gänse]. 

S at the end of a word is pronounced ‘s’.
[es, Gans, Glas]. 

The spelling ss is always pronounced ‘s’ too.
 [Flüsse, Guss, schoss].

ß, which only occurs in the middle and at the end of words, is always pronounced ‘s’.
ß indicates that any vowel preceding it is long.
[bloß, reißen, schießen]. 

sch is pronounced ‘sh’.
[Schule, fischen, Tisch].

sp at the beginning of a word is pronounced ‘shp’.
[spät, Spaten, Spatz]. 
This is also the case in compounds and derived words where the sp is still ‘beginning’ of the word.
[Aussprache, verspätet, spät].

In the middle of a word, however, sp is pronounced ‘sp’.
[lispeln, Wespe].

There are parallels here with the way sp is pronounced. At the
beginning of a word it is pronounced ‘sht’, e.g. 
[Stadt, stehen,stoßen]. 

This is also the case in compounds and derived words
where the st is still seen as being at the ‘beginning’ of the word,
[Ausstoß, Großstadt, verstehen ,stehen].

In the middle and at the end of a word st is
pronounced ‘st’.
[Gast, gestern, bist].

t is pronounced as in English.
[Tag, rot, bitte]

At the beginning of a word it is aspirated, as in English.
In French loanwords ending in -tion, t is pronounced ‘ts’.
[Nation, national].

 tsch is pronounced like ‘tch’ in ‘butcher’.
[Deutsch,Dolmetscher, Quatsch.] 
It only occurs at the beginning in foreign words.
[Tschechien, tschüs.]

v is pronounced ‘f’ in true German words
[Vater, von, Volk].

At the beginning of loanwords v is pronounced as in English.
[Vase, Veteran, Video, Violine].

v occurs at the end of some loanwords, in which case it is
pronounced ‘f’ (=> it is devoiced), but when v is no longer in final
position, it is pronounced ‘v’.
 [aktiv, passiv, aktive].

w is pronounced ‘v’.
[Wasser, wir, Wurm].

x, which is rare in German, is always pronounced ‘ks’.
[nix,Xylophon].

y is pronounced the same as long ü. 
[typisch, Zylinder,zynisch]

z is pronounced ‘ts’, e.g. Polizei, zählen, zittern. Sometimes
it occurs together with t but the pronunciation is still ‘ts’.
[Glotze, Platz, Spritze].
